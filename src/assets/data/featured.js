Spores are produced by a variant of cell division.  Some species produce endospores, engulfing the forespore and maturing it in the cytoplasm of the mother cell before releasing it by lysis.  Other species produce exospores that are released to the environment directly.  Once a spore encounters favorable conditions, it transitions back to a metabolically active (and environmentally vulnerable) cell.",

        "detailOne": "Some bacteria use contractile injection machinery similar to the DNA-delivery machinery of phage tails to shoot toxin-tipped spears into neighboring cells.  Type VI secretion systems assemble in the cytoplasm of the cell, attached to the membrane. To fire, the outer sheath contracts into a shorter, wider conformation, powering the ejection of the inner rod into the target cell.  Huge arrays of a related structure in a marine bacterium are released by lysis.  These arrays provide a signal for a tubeworm to settle onto a surface and differentiate, so they're known as morphogenesis-associated contractile structures (MACs).",

The capsid of the phage is packed with the viral DNA, which is subsequently injected into the host. Following replication, they lyse the host cell to release the new viral particles. Some archaeal viruses do this with seven-sided pyramidal structures that assemble in the host membrane and open to lyse the cell.",
